Burned out on all the new-fangled graphics and dazzling eye candy on your shiny new iPhone?

Nostalgic for a simpler time?

Then take advantage of those crisp high-resolution fonts to relive the glory days of the Great Underground Empire, or play any of hundreds of great works from the Interactive Fiction archive.

## 2008/08/06 Update ##

Well, it took a little longer than I expected, but Frotz has received a major overhaul and the new official version now suports ZBlorb files (with display of artwork), has an integrated web portal to IFDB and other Interaction Fiction resources, and lots of bug fixes and interface polish.  Frotz has been submitted to the App Store and hopefully will be available soon.

I still don't have any definitive answer about the SDK NDA, I'll make the source available here as soon as I can.

### 2008/06/11 Update ###

I have Frotz working under the iPhone SDK and will be putting it on the App Store for free next week after I work out some issues with how to get game files onto the phone.  I'll putting the source up here as soon as I can verify for sure that the iPhone SDK NDA has definitely expired.  (There seems to be some confusion on the point.  If anyone has a link to a definitive answer, let me know.)

**A good starting point for exploring the wealth of Interactive Fiction is availale at the  [Interactive Fiction Archive](http://wurb.com:80/if/platform/1).**

I recommend using the Search option to find games for the Z-Code platform that have a 4- or 5-star rating, or looking at the top entries for the annual Interactive Fiction contest.

Please note that only games written for the Z-Code platform are supported by Frotz, including all original Infocom games except the ones with graphics.   (Frotz does not yet support games with graphics, which can be identified in the IF Archive as Z-Code version 6).
